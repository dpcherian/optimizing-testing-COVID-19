    "3. Removed all trace of \"dead\" states\n",
    "4. Fixed error causing negative populations. Now, for `dt = 0.1` there should be no errors. The reason for errors is the following: in case there are more people that need to be moved from a compartment than there are in that compartment, the numbers are adjusted so that the total number of people moved from that becomes the maximum number currently in it, and the *fractions* of people moved remains the same. For example, if you had 7 people in a compartment (say I) an 10 had to move to R and 2 to H, then the code changes the numbers to $$n_{IR} = \\Big[\\frac{10}{12}\\times 7 \\Big] = 6 \\\\ n_{IH} = \\Big[\\frac{2}{12}\\times 7 \\Big] = 1$$ In the process of rounding the numbers, the result occasionally becomes greater than the total number.\n",
